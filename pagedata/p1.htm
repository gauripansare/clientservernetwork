        <p>The key learning objectives for this simulation are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identify the various types and characteristics of servers used on client/server networks.
            </li>
            <li>Determine which servers are appropriate to use in given situations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are participating in the installation or expansion of a client/server network.</p>
        <p>In this simulation, you get to decide which servers would best serve the needs of a company, based on descriptions
            of the company’s needs. You will apply what you’ve learned about servers.</p>
